# Will the customer accept the coupon?

## Problem Statement
The project is focused on a data analysis titled "Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?" It explores factors influencing whether a driver accepts a coupon delivered via mobile while driving, such as destination type, time of day, weather, or car passengers.


## Analysis
The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and EDA was conducted using .info() and .describe() to explore the data. I used matplotlib and seaborn for EDA â€” to explore correlations, distributions, and acceptance patterns



## Independent Investigation
The independent investigation examined which factors influence acceptance rates for different combinations of variables. While the dataset contains many attributes that could be relevant, this assignment explores only a selected subset.
All related code, visualizations, and analysis summaries can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled prompt.ipynb within this repository.
